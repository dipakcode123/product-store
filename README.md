Product Store MERN Stack Application
Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It serves as a simple product management system where users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product listings. It's designed to demonstrate a basic MERN stack implementation for managing inventory.
